This script.sh file is used to generate a PCA plot of the gene read counts after the RNA-seq data has been mapped to the zebrafish reference genome. The PCA plot here has been generated using the following data set in NCBI: https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/?view=study&acc=SRP430347

This data is linked to this reference: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34358914/
