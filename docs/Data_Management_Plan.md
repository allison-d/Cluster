# Data Management Plan

![banner](assets/o_fragrans.jpg)


This document describes how the data and associated scripts will be stored and updated by those with access to the github site. The members of the bioinformatics team will be involved in the analysis of sequencing data and this site will be used to share analysis scripts between team members. Each type of analysis will have its own folder and all team members will be able to
access all of the folders. Each folder however will have one team member who is the primary contributor and they will be in charge of the oversight of any modifications 
made to code in that folder. 

## 1. Data Description
This repository will store code that is used for data analysis and will include README files for all folders within the project. Raw data files will not be stored on this site. If a data set is needed to test the code, the accession number for a suitable dataset that is publicly available in NCBI will be included in the README.

## 2. Data Collection
No raw data will be included on this site.

## 3. Data Storage and Backup
A copy of all folders stored on this site will have a secondary copy located on the compute cluster. 

## 4. Data Organization and Documentation
All code for a specific analysis type will exist in its own folder. Ideally scripts would be well annotated such that any team member could easily run the scripts based on the available documentation. A README file will exist in all folders to describe the input and output file types and locations. 

## 5. Data Preservation and Long-Term Access
Since this site will not be used for raw data storage, the analysis scripts will be the only file type that will be stored for long-term access. Thus, not much storage space will be needed for project preservation as it will mainly be used as a site for sharing code within the team.

## 6. Data Sharing and Access
This github site and its contents will be available to anyone that is actively working on any of the bioinformatics projects.

## 7. Data Ethics and Legal Compliance
As this project will likely include code that has already been generated by previous research teams, a license which allows for the modification of existing code would be helpful for the goals of this site. Any script which reuses code from another source will be credited within the code, and the reasons for any modifications will be documented within the code. The GNU General Public Licence v3 will be used.

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities
Each folder on this site will contain code that will be availble to all team members such that any team member can comment on code or make suggestions for edits. Each folder however will be maintained by one primary developer and they will oversee all changes that are made to its code. The folder developer will also be responsible for adding and updating README text files when needed.

## 9. Budget and Resources
The resources required for data storage for this project should be fairly minimal as no large datasets will be uploaded to this site.
